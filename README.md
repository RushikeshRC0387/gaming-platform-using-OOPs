This Python code simulates PUBG installation, user account creation, gender selection, and game training. It provides user interaction, input validation, and returns success/failure messages. Suitable for educational or text-based game development.
This code is a Python implementation that simulates a simplified PUBG (PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds) environment, consisting of several classes:

PUBG Class: This class is responsible for simulating the installation of the PUBG game. It displays a message indicating the installation process and returns a success message.

Create_Account Class: It allows users to create an account with a username and password. The class also provides a login mechanism where users can enter their credentials and choose to log in via mobile number, Facebook, or Google. It performs basic input validation and returns success or failure messages.

Gender Class: This class allows users to select their gender, either male or female. It returns the chosen gender or an "invalid input" message.

Training Class: This class provides game rules and instructions. It explains the game's ranking system, weapon selection (AKM or M24), and the gameplay process, including how to accumulate kills and increase ranks. It returns the game rules as a formatted text block and provides feedback on the player's performance during the training game.

The code creates instances of these classes and calls their methods to demonstrate their functionality. The code includes input validation and error handling to ensure a more robust user experience. This code is suitable for educational purposes or as a basis for a text-based simulation game.
